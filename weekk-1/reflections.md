# 1.1 Think About Time

I learned some pretty great time-management and productivity ideas. One of them being meditation, a really great way to stay stress-free by giving the brain a break. Another great way to be productive is to be self-aware. This helps you stay humble and keep yourself honest with yourself. This is great when you're facing a situation you don't understand and must reflect on to get through. Also, the growth mindset is great because it's a mindset where there is no giving up or putting yourself down. It's when you believe in yourself. Time-boxing is to work on something for a set time then stop to reflect on the work rather than continuing to work for a long time until the task is finished. In phase 0 I can use this when working on a problem, it's a way of stepping back for a moment and look at the big picture and continue working. My current strategy is similar to time-boxing, I usually study for a bit, take a break to do something short and fun, then continue studying. I will definitely employ time-boxing when working in a pair so we both stay on the same page when working on assignments. My overall plan for phase 0 is to work on one section of the module at a time until I am done with it, if I am stuck, I will look for help.
