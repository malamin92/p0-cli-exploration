# 1.1 Think About Time

I learned some pretty great time-management and productivity ideas. One of them being meditation, a really great way to stay stress-free by giving the brain a break. Another great way to be productive is to be self-aware. This helps you stay humble and keep yourself honest with yourself. This is great when you're facing a situation you don't understand and must reflect on to get through. Also, the growth mindset is great because it's a mindset where there is no giving up or putting yourself down. It's when you believe in yourself. Time-boxing is to work on something for a set time then stop to reflect on the work rather than continuing to work for a long time until the task is finished. In phase 0 I can use this when working on a problem, it's a way of stepping back for a moment and look at the big picture and continue working. My current strategy is similar to time-boxing, I usually study for a bit, take a break to do something short and fun, then continue studying. I will definitely employ time-boxing when working in a pair so we both stay on the same page when working on assignments. My overall plan for phase 0 is to work on one section of the module at a time until I am done with it, if I am stuck, I will look for help. 

# 1.2 The Command Line

A shell is a user interface that allows us to execute commands on a computer. The "bash" is the specific shell that is made for the unix operating system. It is a command line interface that allows us too navigate and modify files and directories on the computer. I am familiar with using terminal on mac so I was familiar with most of these commands. The new things I learned are how to look inside a file and how to search inside a file. I was able to execute all the commands. I think the most important commands are the navigation commands such as 'cd' and '..' along with 'pwd' because it allows you to see where you are. It's also useful to be able to make new files with 'touch' and 'new' because it just saves time.

Commands and their purpose:

pwd - see what directory the user is currently in.

ls - see the list of files and folders in the present directory or specified directory.

mv - move file from one directory to another.

cd - change directory.

../ - go up a directory.

touch - make a new file.

mkdir - make a new folder/directory.

less - look inside a file and have it disappear when you quit.

rmdir - remove a folder/dir.

rm - remove a file.

help - see a list of valid commands in bash.
